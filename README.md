# Vision Language Models (VLMs)

This repository provides a comprehensive guide to Vision Language Models (VLMs) and demonstrates their use for processing and fine-tuning on multimodal tasks. VLMs combine image processing with language generation, enabling capabilities like image captioning, visual question answering (VQA), and multimodal reasoning. Additionally, we explore methods to fine-tune VLMs for specific tasks and align them with human preferences.

## Repository Contents

### Using Vision Language Models
Learn how to leverage VLMs for a variety of multimodal tasks. VLMs combine image encoders, embedding projectors, and text decoders to seamlessly process and generate text based on visual inputs.

**What's Inside**:
- **Image Captioning**: Automatically generate descriptions for images.
- **Visual Question Answering (VQA)**: Answer questions based on image content.
- **Text Recognition (OCR)**: Extract and interpret text from images.
- **Video Understanding**: Analyze and describe videos using sequential frame processing.

### Fine-Tuning Vision Language Models
This section focuses on adapting pre-trained VLMs to specific tasks or domains through fine-tuning. The goal is to optimize performance for tasks like domain-specific VQA, creative image analysis, or chart interpretation.

**What's Inside**:
- **Efficient Fine-Tuning**: Techniques like quantization, gradient checkpointing, and PEFT (e.g., LoRA) for memory-efficient training.
- **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)**: Train models on labeled datasets for task-specific adaptations.
- **Preference Optimization**: Align models with human preferences using methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).
